  <h2>Mission</h2>

  <div class="info_section">
    <p>The Homosaurus is an international linked data vocabulary of LGBTQ+ terms. Designed to enhance broad subject term vocabularies, the Homosaurus is a robust and cutting-edge thesaurus that advances the discoverability of LGBTQ+ resources and information.</p>
  </div>

 <h2>History</h2>
  <div class="info_section">
    <p>The Homosaurus was originally created in 1997 by <%= link_to "IHLIA LGBT Heritage", "https://www.ihlia.nl/?lang=en", target: "_blank" %> as a Dutch and English gay and lesbian thesaurus that was used as a standalone vocabulary to describe their collections. Over time, terms relating to bisexuality, trans, gender, and intersex concepts were added, but not methodically. This original version of the vocabulary (which we refer to as version 0) had an overly flat structure and, due to the lack of connections, terms were too isolated from one another and therefore easily missed. But, it became apparent that a vocabulary developed by an LGBTQ archives to describe LGBTQ resources could be a powerful tool.</p>

    <p>In 2013, Jack van der Wel, with the help of Ellen Greenblatt, transformed the original Homosaurus into a more inclusive and hierarchical thesaurus (<%= link_to "version 1", vocabulary_index_path(id: "terms"), target: "_blank" %>). Hundreds of terms were added and each term was put in relation to others in a hierarchical structure. At this point, the vocabulary only existed as an offline document that was circulated as a Word document or PDF. The results of this major editing project were presented at numerous LGBTQ ALMS Conferences and the vocabulary began to be used by other LGBTQ archives, libraries, and documentation centres throughout the world. </p>

    <p>In 2015, the <%= link_to "Digital Transgender Archive", "https://www.digitaltransgenderarchive.net", target: "_blank" %> (DTA) became one of the handful of LGBTQ archives using version 1 of the Homosaurus to describe resources in their collections. When it became apparent to the DTA’s Director, K.J. Rawson, how useful the vocabulary was and how many institutions could benefit from using it, he collaborated with Jack van der Wel to transform version 1 into an online linked data vocabulary. This dramatically increased the accessibility of the vocabulary and allowed cultural institutions from around the world to link to a common vocabulary.</p>

    <p>In 2016, Rawson and van der Wel then established an Editorial Board to oversee a second major revision of the Homosaurus. The board ultimately decided to transform the Homosaurus from a broader, standalone vocabulary (which included hundreds of non-LGBTQ terms, e.g., “advertising” and “literature”) to a narrower, LGBTQ-specific vocabulary that was intended to supplement existing thesauri (primarily the Library of Congress Subject Headings). This was a major conceptual shift and this revision resulted in version 2, which is the current version of the vocabulary.</p>

    <p>In May, 2019, version 2 of the Homosaurus was released as a linked data vocabulary and is still accessible at <%= link_to "https://homosaurus.org/v2", vocabulary_index_path(id: "v2") %>.</p>

    <p>In September 2021, version 3 of the Homosaurus changed identifiers to be more consistent along with adding some initial language support. This is the current version of the vocabulary available today at: <%= link_to "https://homosaurus.org/v3", vocabulary_index_path(id: "v3") %>. The Editorial Board is now focused on publicizing the project and making ongoing edits to the vocabulary.</p>

            <p class="walter_cat_walker_tribute">
              Walter "Cat" Walker served as the Head Cataloging Librarian at Loyola Marymount University in Los Angeles, California from 2004 until his untimely death in 2020. He was also a Director-at-Large of the American Library Association's Gay Lesbian Bisexual Transgender Roundtable (ALA GLBTRT) and he volunteered at the ONE National Gay & Lesbian Archives at the USC Libraries for 25 years.
            <br /><br />
              Cat Walker joined the Editorial Board of the Homosaurus in 2016 after he met Jack van der Wel at the LGBTQ ALMS conference in London. At this conference, Cat presented a keynote titled "Overcoming the Barriers: Improving Access to LGBTQ+ Content in Collections." Cat’s lifelong activism and passion for LGBTQ libraries and archives motivated him to join the Editorial Board and he quickly became an active member of our team. At the next LGBTQ ALMS Conference in Berlin in 2019, Cat and Jack presented a paper together on the Abridged Homosaurus.
              <br /><br />
              It is difficult to overstate Cat's contributions to the Homosaurus over the four years that he worked on the project. As the board dramatically revised the first version of the Homosaurus, Cat played a central role in helping us to make use of many more terms and LGBTQ-related contexts, representations, and histories. Cat worked extensively on reconciling Homosaurus version one to version two, examining the vocabulary with a close eye and pulling terms that required revision, lacked consistency across the list, or had a unique value that could be extended for related searches and needs. This list, composed of new suggested terms as well as adaptations of existing ones, was one of Cat’s most recent and ambitious contributions to the board’s work. At the time of his death, his documentation of related and suggested terms encompassed over 250 changes and/or new terms––important work that we will be sure to complete on his behalf and in his honor.
              <br /><br />
              Above all, Cat was a patient, kind, and gracious teacher and collaborator and he was always the first to volunteer to take on new projects. Cat’s attention to detail, as well as his commitment to making the Homosaurus a truly beautiful and inclusive set of terms, will be impossible to replace. We are endlessly grateful to him as we celebrate all that he contributed to this important project.
